# JavaScript 2, year 2- 

This was our first project in the first year of our Studies-
This was initially our introduction into design and CSS, then an exercise in stretching our JavaScript skills.
The main purpose of this site was to advertise and sell games at competitive prices, to be able to view them and their specific details and to add them to your cart.


Our Brief:

    To complete the required features, you will also need to make use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.

    You must use JSDocs to document at least one function. The minimum requirement is one example of well written JSDocs for a function that includes argument types, return types, a description and a usage example. If you have remaining time before delivery, you should use this to document all of your remaining functions.

    Using localStorage is highly recommended, especially for storing JWT tokens.

    A finished project fulfils the requirements below with an easy to use and error-free user interface.

    Required features

    The following user stories are required for a passing submission:

    User with @noroff.no or @stud.noroff.no email can register profile
    Registered user can login
    User can view a post content feed
    User can filter the post content feed
    User can search the post content feed
    User can view a post content item by ID
    User can create a post content item
    User can update a post content item
    User can delete a post content item
    Additional features

    The following user stories are optional:

    User can create a comment on a post
    User can edit profile media
    User can follow/unfollow a profile
    User can react to a post content item`





## Workflow and "To Do" list- 

    Create or select one repository to use throughout this project.
    Create a js2 branch from the default master or main branch.
    You may use either Trello or GitHub Projects to manage your development tasks. If you are using Trello, please make sure that your board is public and that a link is provided in your readme.md file. Make sure to detail tasks accurately and divide them evenly if working a group.

    Examples of detailed & accurate tasks (My tasks added as completed) see an "X" next to each completed task:


    Create new repository for work,
    Undo bootstrap stylings (I did not like the finstionality)
    create new forms and style them
    Fix file structure (I did this THREE TIMES!)
    Create Login forms
    create register forms
    Style login and register forms- 
    Add default functionality

    Add 



    Yet to:
    


    Create search form HTML
    Search form SCSS styling
    Filter posts function
    Implement search event listener
    Review the API Documentation and API Swagger.
    Plan your approach, desired features and work strategy.
    Implement the required features as per your work plan.


    ---Review 2 of your peers projects. (4 per team)

    Open a Pull Request from js2 into the default branch.



## Site purpose:

A game purchasing site with competitive prices and smooth functionality. You should be able to see a full display of the games on offer, and them add them to a semi functioning cart. (Main purpose-- to buy games.)



### Description

-- Home Page

Our home page was meant to introduce the site adequately, so at a glance it was obvious what the site did- 
Thous would be via a title or to introduce the games- i tried to do both.
This page should be easily to navigate through, and show clear options to view ore details about the games being sold. 

-- Games 

The user should have the option to click on one of the games displayed either on the home page, or a page where a selection of the games can be viewed, and be taken to a page the displays more information- 

-- Info page

The page where the user can see more of the pertinent details about their prospective purchase, the price, if said game is on sale, how many players, the genre and a descriptive paragraph about the gameplay and adventure ahead.

-- buy now

Upon clicking the "Buy Now"/ "Add to cart" button on either the home page or the product details page, the number next to the cart icon should increase. 
Whwn clicking on the cart icon itself, there should be visible a list of the games (or an empty cart if you have not selected any of the games), their prices, a running total and a "complete purchase" button that accurately simulates the buying process.


-- Contact Page

This page should have form validation, and simulate the process of emailing the hosts of the site.

-- Other Pages

For the functionality of the site the other pages are not integral- should inclide an "About us" page.
